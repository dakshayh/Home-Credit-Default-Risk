# Home-Credit-Default-Risk

This project discusses the business use case and need for a machine learning algorithm to assess the Home credit default risk of a borrower.

# Need for a Solution & Our Approach:

For a very long time, banks and other investment institutions have hired many analysts in order to detect credit risk. With the big data revolution and the advent of data science, a more quantitative approach can be taken to the issue. That is what inspired our team to tackle this issue. The issue of Home credit default risk has a historic and well-documented business case with implications involving the general public, lenders, borrowers, employees as well as government institutions who may be responsible for backing deposits that are loaned out.
